What if Ted Bundy escapes prison for the third time and goes and kills 50 more victims. Ted Bundy was America's most notorious serial killer, he kill over 30 women through (1974-1977). Ted Bundy was a straight-up charmer he could make women fall to his knees and that is how he did. He would gain the women’s trust then kidnap, then r**ed, and finally kill them. He was caught on August 16, 1975, escape on June 7, 1977 – June 13, 1977, then escape again on December 30, 1977 – February 15, 1978. After his second escape, he was put in maximum security, but with the help of two female prison guards ( that easily fell for his charm “stupids”) he was able to escape again (queue the eye roll) and would evaded police for the next  7 years. He was able to avoid police for so long  because he completely change his M.O. Instead of luring victims with his charm or faking an injury. He would stalk his victims for days then when the moment is right he would attack them  from behind then take them to a secondary location where he would torture them….. (the things he did are too graphic for school so sorry) :(   the way he torture them  he  got off on it and he went on to kill 50 more victims in 2 years, but in 1980 after killing his 50th victim he stop (gasp) out of nowhere  he didn't know why. He laid low for the next five years. Until  August 8, 1985 urges came back and he started planning his next kill. Then on August 14, 1985, he kidnaps a young girl named Maya 17 years old outside a gas station. He took her to a secondary location where he torture her, but little did Ted know Maya´s dad had a tracker on her phone. A phone he fail to dispose of (stupid) ( I mean come on you have a 136 IQ and you can´t remember to dispose of a phone like are you new to this) (queue the eye roll) the police were able to find out where Maya was when they got to the location and busted through the door they saw something that will haunt them for the rest of their lives. They saw Maya all bloody and Ted was……

I was going to talk about what if this serial killer escaped prison or was never caught, but for the next two slides  I going to be talking about two cases that haunts me, that makes my blood boil, and that make me livid. I going talking about the murder of Junko Furuta and the muder of Anne Bates.
</p>
<h3>Junko Furuta</h3>
<p> 
   Junko Furuta was a japanese high school student that never did anything wrong always followed the rule never drink,smoke,cuss, or disrespectful she was an angle. One day Yakuza ask Junko out and she said no because she knew he reputation. Yakuza was not happy about getting rejected he through a temper-tantrum and may plan to get back at her for rejecting him. So one day junko was riding her bike and Yakauza friends kick her bike and ran while she fell to the ground Yakauza came out of nowhere help her up ask her if he could take her home she say yes but instead he took her to a warehouse where him and his friends r***d her then took her to Minto´s house (one of Yakauza  friends) where they torture her for 44 days. I´m not going to go into details about what they did to her because it is just awful and horrible. Her body was later found on March 29, 1989. And what makes me livid about this case is all the boys got only got 5 to 20 years.

<h3> Kelly Anne Bates </h3>
<p> 
Kelly Anne Bates was killed by someone who told her he loved her. James Patterson Smith is a disgusting pig who torture Kelly so brutally it makes me sick to my stomach. I can't even describe what he did. Kelly and James were quote on quote ¨in love¨ but the problem was she was 16 years old and he was 40 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!!. Who could be okay with this? Kelly´s mother was okay with it but later regretted it. Kelly and James started dating when Kelly was 14, then kept it a secret for 2 years. After Kelly told her mother about James she moved in with him. Now here's the problem James has a LONG history of beating women and Kelly was known differently first it was hitting it escalated into torture. Leading up to her death her body had 150 injuries on it and I´m not telling you the injuries. Kelly die on April 16, 1996, by drowning. Oh and this dummy reported to police that his TEENAGE GIRLFRIEND accidentally drowned and took them to the body even though there were over 150 INJURES ON HER BODY when she die. What makes me angry about is just like the other one he only got 20 years for what he did to her.

        <h3>Richard Ramirez</h3>    

    <p>
    
    What if  Richard Ramirez ( night stalker) was never caught? What if he is still out there? Richard Ramiez is a well-known serial killer and one of my favorite serial killers (and don't mean like what he did was amazing I mean how he started and the way he killed). He has killed over 100 people so far ranging from 6-year-old girls to adult women. He likes to hunt never schools mainly high schools, on highways at night, in parks during the day and night, or he would just break into the victim's houses. You’ll never see him coming he attacks quickly leaving no evidence behind but the way he kills is not fast. He likes to torture them slowly make sure they feel each bit of it. He also likes to taunt the victim's family and the police working the case by sending the picture of the woman’s body, sending them the woman's ear, fingers, and sending the woman's scalps. What makes no sense about this is that Richard Ramirez's body was found on the side road on June 7, 2013. So if he die in 2013 who doing the killings?

       <h3>Massacres</h3>     
    <p>
What if The Golden State, Jack the Ripper, Son of Sam, and Zodiac Killer all came together to pull off one of the worst massacres in the world killing over 220 people in one month. (FYI this is not the world’s worst massacre but in the story, it will be) On one calm night Jack the Ripper was sitting in his studying room drinking a whisky plotting his next kill when he got an idea. After thinking about it for a while he decided to act on his plan a plan that will paint the streets of New Orleans red. It’s Mardi Gras hundred of thousands of people come to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and Jack knew it was the perfect time to do this. He called up some of his friends who he knew would be down for this plan. It’s the three-night of Mardi Gras and Jack and his friend were in position. They waited and waited when the moment was right they attack. stabbing anybody that runs. When they were done it was a blood bath. The street was painted red just like jack thought and in the middle of the street stood Jack the Ripper, Son of Sam, Zodiac Killer, and The Golden State killer all bloody and smirking at what they have done.
